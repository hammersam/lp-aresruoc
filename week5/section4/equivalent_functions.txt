Once you have mutation, side effects, printing, we suddenly have to worry
about the order we do things, and different orders, lead to functions that
are not equivalent. But if we stick to a functional style, where don't write
functions with side effects, then we do not have to worry about order, and
we can execute these functions in either order.
